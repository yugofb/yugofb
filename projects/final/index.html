                <p>Have you considered sending your child to preschool? Every year, another round of parents must decide whether or not to enroll their 3- and 4-year-olds in pre-kindergarten. Since most states do not require children to attend pre-K, some families may opt to use daycares, babysitters or nannies to watch over their children. But research indicates that pre-K may provide lifelong benefits for young children.</p>

                <p> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2023.01.011">According to a study published in 2023,</a> children who attend pre-K tend to outperform their peers. These children often excel in skills preschools prioritize, such as language, literacy and mathematics. This study, along with numerous others, suggest that pre-K programs are an important tool in preparing children for school. Even though it isn't required, many parents send their children to pre-K solely for the educational benefits.</p>

                <p>However, there is a group of children whos early education was compromised.</p>

            <p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Maryland had stable pre-K enrollment rates. The five largest school districts – Baltimore City, Anne Arundel county, Baltimore county, Montgomery county and Prince George’s county – had little to no yearly variation in the size of their student body. But as the graph above shows, the pandemic changed everything.</p>

            <p>In 2020, Maryland saw a 26 percent drop in pre-K enrollments compared to the previous school year. Baltimore city public schools saw the largest change with a whopping 36 percent decrease in pre-K students. </p>

            <p>One contributor to lower enrollment rates were long-term preschool closures. In addition, work from home initiatives and layoffs led many parents to stay home with their children. While this alleviated some parents' need for child care, it also meant that many children were barred from receiving the benefits associated with pre-K.</p>

            <p>But why does this drop in pre-K enrollment matter?</p>

                        <p>America is currently enduring one of the worst education crises ever seen. <a href="https://cepr.harvard.edu/sites/hwpi.harvard.edu/files/cepr/files/explaining_covid_losses_5.23.pdf">Recent data analysis</a> indicates the average student is behind by three-quarters of a school year. Students in districts that were heavily impacted by the pandemic are even further behind.</p>

                        <p>Now, the children who had the first step of their educational journeys disrupted by the pandemic are in second and third grade. This is the first year any of these students can take the MCAP, an annual assessment taken by Maryland students from third to eighth grade.</p>

                    <p>MCAP results are used to identify where students are struggling. While we have had some information about these students, this is the first time we will have data that pinpoints where this specific age group needs more support.</p>

                    <p>While students in general are behind, a large number of children in this age group didn't get the benefits of attending pre-K. By comparing their MCAP scores to previous years, educators may be able to identify areas these children need additional support and get them back on track.</p>
